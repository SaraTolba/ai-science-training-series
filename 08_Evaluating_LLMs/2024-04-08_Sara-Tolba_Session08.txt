Session08 Homework:

Q: What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it?

A:

Journals peer-reviewed Papers:
Well-trained LLMs can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of initial evaluation for new research papers, assessing authenticity, relevance to the journal, and structural integrity.

Generate Hypothesis and Ideas: 
trained LLMs on literature can help to develop hypotheses based on prior information and data. By giving appropriate background and feedback, LLMs might recommend potential research areas, hypotheses, experimental techniques, or setups to explore.

Explore and predict new materials and molecules: 
During this training I got the idea to explore in the future, well-trained LLMs model on chemical structure's notations/compositions to predict new possible molecules or polymers.
